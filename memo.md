# Plan for Future Updates
## Multiple versions for masks
To develop different versions of which each has less masks than the orginal shader in order to save rendering resources and to be adopted by a specific demand.

The naming method could be taken in format as:

_Multi-Masks CxNxF version_

where C stands for the amount of color masks; N for normal masks; and F, fluid mask. Therefore the original shader could have a name like below:

_Multi-Masks 2x3x1 v1.4.0_
