# An Overview of Multi-Masks the Shader
Multi-Masks is a Unity shader written by [Bl@ke](https://www.blatke.cc), with shaderlab codes, on October 15, 2024. It makes users possible to manipulate the colors and bump effects in a material by adopting some RGB textures as masks.

There are currently 7 sections in the shader including:

## Main

This section works for the basic shader functions such like:

**Albedo** referring to main texture; 

**Tint Color** that decides the base color blending with the albedo; This property also controls the cutout effect on a transparent texture imported in the Albedo by using its alpha value;

**Occlusion** that decides to what extent the material shows the constrast between the brightness and darkness under the lights; 

**Metallic** and **Smoothness** that decide the how the material reflects the lights and background colors; 

and **OMS** that is an RGB texture indicating which parts on the material and to what extent the Occlusion, Metallic and Smoothness do their performance.

## Normal Maps

This section serves for the basic bump effects on a material.

**Normal Map**, referring to a bump texture;

**Normal Strength**, deciding to what extent the bump caused by Normal Map should perform;

**Detail Normal Map** that allows users to import another bump texture that will blend with the one in Normal Map;

**Detail Normal Strength**, deciding to what extent the bump caused by Detail Normal Map should perform.

## Fresnel

Fresnel effect, in technical, refers to a sort of reflection of light among which the distance from a particular part of the object to the viewer (camera) leads to a different performance in reflection. Such like it on the surface of a lake, you might see quit deep or even the stones under the lake when you're looking at the water near by your feet; and might see the reflection of the sky when you're watching the water at the horizon. In a shorter distance, the reflection is weak; and for a long distance, strong.

This section simulates something like Fresnel effect in which the parts at the edges of the object may get an additional color or emission whereas the ones not at the edges may not. It can be divided into two subsections:

### For Emission

Fresnel Emission Color, deciding the color that the material emits under Fresnel effect;

Fresnel Emission Exp (exponent), deciding the width of the edges at which the emission does perform or not;

Fresnel Emission Strength, deciding the instensity of the emission;

Fresnel Emission Revert, for this property, it can revert the parts on which the emission functions which means the parts at the edges of the object may not have the effect whereas the rests may have.

### For Albedo

Fresnel Albedo Color, deciding the color that the material blends with other colors under Fresnel effect;

Fresnel Albedo Exp, deciding the width of the edges at which the color blending does perform or not;

Fresnel Albedo Strength, deciding the instensity of the color that blends with others;

Fresnel Albedo Revert, for this property, it can revert the parts on which the color blending functions which means the parts at the edges of the object may not have the effect whereas the rests may have.
