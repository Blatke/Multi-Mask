# An Overview of Multi-Masks the Shader
Multi-Masks is a Unity shader written by [Bl@ke](https://www.blatke.cc), with shaderlab codes, on October 15, 2024. It makes users possible to manipulate the colors and bump effects in a material by adopting some RGB textures as masks.

> [!NOTE]
> The term, "mask", I use in the tutorials and in this shader, always refer to an RGB texture that might have at most 7 different basic colors on it: Red(1,0,0), Green(0,1,0), Blue(0,0,1), Cyan(0,1,1), Purple(1,0,1), Yellow(1,1,0) and White(1,1,1).
>
> The gradient colors between any one of them and Black(0,0,0), such like dark-green(0,0.5,0) or deep-red(0.5,0,0) or gray(0.5,0.5,0.5), are also acceptable to function.

There are currently 7 sections in the shader including:

## Main
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca6e0e69-270c-40cf-85e6-6841fff7cb04)

This section works for the basic shader functions such like:

**Albedo** referring to main texture; 

**Tint Color** that decides the base color blending with the albedo; This property also controls the cutout effect on a transparent texture imported in the Albedo by using its alpha value;

**Occlusion** that decides to what extent the material shows the constrast between the brightness and darkness under the lights; 

**Metallic** and **Smoothness** that decide the how the material reflects the lights and background colors; 

and **OMS** that is an RGB texture indicating which parts on the material and to what extent the Occlusion, Metallic and Smoothness do their performance.

## Normal Maps

This section serves for the basic bump effects on a material.

**Normal Map**, referring to a bump texture;

**Normal Strength**, deciding to what extent the bump caused by Normal Map should perform;

**Detail Normal Map** that allows users to import another bump texture that will blend with the one in Normal Map;

**Detail Normal Strength**, deciding to what extent the bump caused by Detail Normal Map should perform.

## Fresnel

Fresnel effect, in technical, refers to a sort of reflection of light among which the distance from a particular part of the object to the viewer (camera) leads to a different performance in reflection. Such like it on the surface of a lake, you might see quit deep or even the stones under the lake when you're looking at the water near by your feet; and might see the reflection of the sky when you're watching the water at the horizon. In a shorter distance, the reflection is weak; and for a long distance, strong.

This section simulates something like Fresnel effect in which the parts at the edges of the object may get an additional color or emission whereas the ones not at the edges may not. It can be divided into two subsections:

### For Emission

**Fresnel Emission Color**, deciding the color that the material emits under Fresnel effect;

**Fresnel Emission Exp** (exponent), deciding the width of the edges at which the emission does perform or not;

**Fresnel Emission Strength**, deciding the instensity of the emission;

**Fresnel Emission Revert**, for this property, it can revert the parts on which the emission functions which means the parts at the edges of the object may not have the effect whereas the rests may have.

### For Albedo

**Fresnel Albedo Color**, deciding the color that the material blends with other colors under Fresnel effect;

**Fresnel Albedo Exp**, deciding the width of the edges at which the color blending does perform or not;

**Fresnel Albedo Strength**, deciding the instensity of the color that blends with others;

**Fresnel Albedo Revert**, for this property, it can revert the parts on which the color blending functions which means the parts at the edges of the object may not have the effect whereas the rests may have. 

## Wetness

This section serves for some effects like weathering that makes the surface of an object show more glossiness by adopting a map.

**Wetness Map**, that has a texture by default for glossiness; the texture can be found [here](https://github.com/Blatke/Multi-Masks.shader/blob/main/Textures/Wetness%20Map.png); 

**Wetness Density**, deciding the thickness, or more accurately, the size of each glossiness spot on the Wetness Map;

**Wetness Strength**, deciding the instensity of glossiness of this Wetness. When it is valued 0, not wetness effect is conducting.

## Fluid

This section functions as simulating static liquid putting on the surface of an object by using some given maps. This section can be divided into two subsections:

### Basic
Fluid Map, that is already given a default texture indicating which parts on the material to have fluid effects; the given texture can be found [here](https://github.com/Blatke/Multi-Masks.shader/blob/main/Textures/Fluid%20Map.png);

Fluid Normal, letting the fluid effects have bumps;the given texture can be found [here](https://github.com/Blatke/Multi-Masks.shader/blob/main/Textures/Fluid%20Normal.png);

Fluid Color, deciding the color of the fluid; the alpha value decides the fluid's transparency;

Fluid Density, deciding the size of the drips of the fluid;

Fluid Glossiness, deciding the instensity of the reflection of each drip of the fluid;

Fluid Emission, letting the fluid emit some lights in order to make fluid more distinguishable on the object's surface;

Fluid Bump, deciding to what extent each drip of the fluid has a bump effect;

Fluid Rotation, letting the Fluid Map as well as Fluid Normal rotate, thus letting the drips change their direction;

### Mask
Fluid Mask, using an RGB texture as a mask to indicate which parts to show or rotate the fluid;
