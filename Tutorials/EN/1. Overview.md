# An Overview of Multi-Masks the Shader
Multi-Masks is a Unity shader written by [Bl@ke](https://www.blatke.cc), with shaderlab surface codes, on October 15, 2024. It makes users possible to manipulate the colors and bump effects in a material by adopting some RGB textures as masks.

There are currently 7 sections in the shader including:

## Main

This section works for the basic shader functions such like:

**Albedo** referring to main texture; 

**Tint Color** that decides the base color blending with the albedo; This property also controls the cutout effect on the Albedo by using its alpha value;

**Occlusion** that decides to what extent the material shows the constrast between the brightness and darkness under the lights; 

**Metallic** and **Smoothness** that decide the how the material reflects the lights and background colors; 

and **OMS** that is an RGB texture indicating which parts on the material and to what extent the Occlusion, Metallic and Smoothness do their performance.
